This project is for Data Science internship opportunity in Xtern.
The project description is the following:

Data Science
Situation

While osXtern has a few highlighted features, the data science team is focusing all of its efforts on expanding osXternâ€™s feature set. As part of the Community Highlights feature, users agree to share their location with TechPointX and any individuals they choose. In future iterations, TechPointX hopes that the Community Highlights data could be used to do more.


In order to help identify what type of information could be surfaced in future iterations, you have been tasked with reviewing the the sample data collected from recent user tests. In your research, highlight any conclusions you believe the data can draw to help guide future development opportunities.

Your Task

Review the test user data, and draw any conclusions you can from the data set. Your research and conclusions should be submitted as a link to a github repository. It is encouraged that your repository hosts a Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebook.
